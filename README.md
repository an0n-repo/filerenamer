# TV Show Episode Renamer

This repository contains a Python script that renames TV show episode files to the 'S00E00' format, which is commonly used for organizing and detecting TV show episodes in media libraries.

## Description

The rename.py script takes file names of TV show episodes that contain the word 'Episode' followed by a number and renames them to a standardized format that includes the season and episode number. 
This format is compatible with most media servers and players, making it easier to sort and access your TV show collection.

## How to Use

1. Place the Python script in the root directory where your TV show folders are located.
2. Ensure that each TV show's episodes are in a separate folder named after the show.
3. Run the script using Python 3 with the command:

python3 rename.py
